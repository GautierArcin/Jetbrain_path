# Q & A

<br>

## Why did you choose to implement a PRM ?

<br>

I was hesitating between force field, RRT and PRM.

Force field wasn't suitable for the map, because it would have not allowed the robot to go in narrow place.

[Articles](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8336197) tends to show that PRM was the best algorithm in term of results to time efficiency. So I choosed that one.

Finally, I already implemented once a RRT, not an PRM. That also pushed me further to choose the PRM.

<br>

## Why did you implement it in Python ?

<br>

Python is way easier to implement something rapidly.
However, C++ is way more suitable for on-board implementation.

<br>

## What's the complexity of the algorithm ?

<br>

This implementation has a quadratic time complexity ( O(nÂ²) ).
